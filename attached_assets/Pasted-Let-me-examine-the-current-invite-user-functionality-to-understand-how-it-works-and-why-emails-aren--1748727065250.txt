Let me examine the current invite user functionality to understand how it works and why emails aren't being sent.


Opened server/routes.ts
I can see the issue! Looking at the invite user functionality, there's a return; statement on line 145 that exits the function early, so the actual invitation logic never executes. The current flow is:

Current Invite User Flow (Broken)
User clicks "Invite User" in the settings page
Request hits the API at /api/user-invitations
Function immediately returns a mock success response (line 145)
No actual invitation is created - the real logic is unreachable
No email is sent because the function exits early
What Should Happen
The commented code shows the intended flow:

Validate admin permissions
Check license limits
Store invitation in database
Send invitation email
User receives email with signup link
Let me fix this by removing the early return and implementing the proper invitation system:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now let me properly implement the invitation system. I need to fix the broken invitation flow and add a proper email invitation system:

Let me check the current invitation function structure first:


Opened server/routes.ts
Looking at the current invite user flow, I can see the issue. Let me explain what's happening:

Current Invite Flow (Why No Emails Are Sent)
User fills out invite form and clicks "Invite User"
API receives the request at /api/user-invitations
Function logs the request but has authentication/organization middleware issues
Returns a mock success response without actually creating invitations or sending emails
No database storage of invitations happens
No email service is configured
Let me view the complete invitation function to show you the exact flow:


Opened server/routes.ts
I can see exactly what's happening with the invite user functionality. The current flow has several issues:

Current Invite Flow Issues
The function is incomplete and doesn't send emails because:

No database storage - Line 164 says "For now, just simulate sending the invitation"
No email service - Comments indicate this needs to be implemented
Missing middleware - No authentication or organization context
Mock response only - Returns success but doesn't actually create invitations
What Should Happen
For a proper invitation system, we need:

Store invitations in database with unique tokens
Email service integration (SMTP/SendGrid/etc.)
Invitation acceptance flow - signup page that accepts tokens
Expiration handling - tokens that expire after a set time
To Fix This
Would you like me to implement a complete invitation system? This would require:

Email Service Setup: I'll need email service credentials (like SMTP settings, SendGrid API key, or similar) to send actual invitation emails.

Database Schema: Add a proper invitations table to track pending invites.

Invitation Flow: Create signup pages that handle invitation tokens.

Should I start implementing this? If you want actual emails sent, please let me know what email service you'd prefer to use, and I can help you set up the required credentials.
